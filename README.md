Expected Result,
Actual Result,
Status (Pass/Fail),
Reproducing steps,
Bug Screenshots,
Developer Coments,

**Test Case:**
Test case is a detailed specification of inputs, execution conditions, testing procedures, and expected results for a particular test scenario, used to verify the functionality or performance of a software application.

**Test Plan:**
A test plan is a comprehensive document that outlines the scope, objectives, resources, schedule, and approach to be used for testing a software application. It includes details such as test strategy, test scenarios, test cases, entry and exit criteria, roles and responsibilities, and risk management strategies.

**Bug Reports:**
A bug report is a document that details information about a defect or issue found during testing. It typically includes information such as the description of the bug, steps to reproduce it, severity level, screenshots or videos if applicable, environment details, and any other relevant information to help developers identify and fix the issue.

**Test Reports:**
A test report is a document that summarizes the testing activities, results, and findings of a particular testing effort. It provides valuable insights into the status of the software under test, the quality of the product, and any issues encountered during testing.Test reports summarizing the overall test results will be generated.

**Test Metrics:**
Test metrics are numerical measures used to evaluate the quality, progress, and efficiency of testing processes, providing insights into coverage, defects, execution, resources, and risks for informed decision-making. In Test metrics dashboards or reports summarizing key testing data (e.g., pass/fail rates, execution time).
