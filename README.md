**Test Case:**
Test case is a detailed specification of inputs, execution conditions, testing procedures, and expected results for a particular test scenario, used to verify the functionality or performance of a software application.


**Mind Map:**
A mind map is a visual representation of ideas, concepts, or processes related to software testing, often used for brainstorming, organizing, and structuring testing strategies, test scenarios, and test cases.

**Test Plan:**
A test plan is a comprehensive document that outlines the scope, objectives, resources, schedule, and approach to be used for testing a software application.

**Test Reports:**
A test report is a document that summarizes the testing activities, results, and findings of a particular testing effort. It provides valuable insights into the status of the software under test, the quality of the product, and any issues encountered during testing.Test reports summarizing the overall test results will be generated.

**Test Metrics:**
Test metrics are numerical measures used to evaluate the quality, progress, and efficiency of testing processes, providing insights into coverage, defects, execution, resources, and risks for informed decision-making. In Test metrics dashboards or reports summarizing key testing data (e.g., pass/fail rates, execution time).
